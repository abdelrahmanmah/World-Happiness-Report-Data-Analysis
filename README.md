This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the World Happiness Report data to explore various social and economic factors that influence happiness across different countries. Our analysis encompasses descriptive data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive data analysis to understand and predict happiness scores based on various indicators.

# Key Findings
- GDP per capita: There is a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and happiness scores, indicating that wealthier countries tend to have happier populations.
- Social Support: Strong social support systems are associated with higher happiness scores, highlighting the importance of community and social networks in contributing to overall well-being.
- Healthy Life Expectancy: Longer healthy life expectancy is positively correlated with happiness, suggesting that better health contributes significantly to happiness.
- Freedom: Countries where individuals feel a greater sense of freedom tend to report higher happiness scores.
- Generosity: While the coefficient for generosity is positive, the p-value is slightly above 0.05, implying that generosity may not be a statistically significant predictor of happiness at the 0.05 level, but it is close enough to warrant further investigation.
- Perceptions of Corruption: Similarly, perceptions of corruption have a positive coefficient with a p-value just above 0.05, indicating a need for further research to determine its exact impact on happiness.
- Additionally, we observed that countries with charming and picturesque natural landscapes often report higher happiness levels, suggesting that the natural environment may also play a role in influencing happiness.
